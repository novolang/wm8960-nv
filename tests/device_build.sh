# tests/device_build.sh — builds the device program,
# examples/playback.nv, for two boards and reports the image
# sizes.
#
# The program is a firmware `main`, so it is built as the `main` of a
# scratch package that depends on this one by path, the way a program on
# a device depends on it.  The boards are the Nordic nRF52840-DK and
# nRF54LM20-DK.  Nothing is flashed.  The emulated board's image
# (nrf52-qemu) is then run under QEMU, where the program has no I2S
# block and I2C bus to drive, and its first line must be the program's
# refusal.
